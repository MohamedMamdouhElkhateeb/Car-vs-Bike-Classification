## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories: cars and bikes. We utilize transfer learning techniques with pre-trained models VGG16 and ResNet to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of cars and bikes. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets. You can download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/car-vs-bike-classification-dataset] .

## Models

We use two popular convolutional neural network architectures for image classification:

- **VGG16**: A deep CNN model known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.
- **ResNet**: A residual network that allows training of very deep networks by using skip connections.
